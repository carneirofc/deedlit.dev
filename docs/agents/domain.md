# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root, or
- **`CONTEXT-MAP.md`** at the repo root if it exists — it points at one `CONTEXT.md` per context. Read each one relevant to the topic.
- **`docs/adr/`** — read ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in. In multi-context repos, also check `<package>/docs/adr/` for context-scoped decisions.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## Layout

This is a **monorepo** with sibling packages (`deedlit.dev/`, `deedlit.dev.comfyhelper/`, `deedlit.dev.ui/`, `deedlit.vision/`, and the new `deedlit.*` FastAPI services). Treat it as single-context for now (one root `CONTEXT.md` + `docs/adr/`) until a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` is introduced. Package-local docs (`<package>/IMAGE_LIBRARY.md`, `<package>/.github/copilot-instructions.md`) are authoritative for that package.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding.
